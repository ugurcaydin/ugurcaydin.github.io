excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigate the robustness of stationary mean-field equilibria in the presence of model uncertainties, specifically focusing on infinite-horizon discounted cost functions.
To achieve this, we initially establish convergence conditions for value iteration-based algorithms in mean-field games. Subsequently, utilizing these results, we demonstrate that the
mean-field equilibrium obtained through this value iteration algorithm remains robust even in
the face of system dynamics misspecifications. We then apply these robustness findings to the
finite model approximation problem in mean-field games, showing that if the state space quantization is fine enough, the mean-field equilibrium for the finite model closely approximates
the nominal one.'
